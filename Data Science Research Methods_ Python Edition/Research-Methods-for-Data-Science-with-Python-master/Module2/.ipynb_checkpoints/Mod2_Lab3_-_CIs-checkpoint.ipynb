    "=====================================\n",
    "\n",
    "This lab provides a brief extension on the previous lab, pointing out\n",
    "something you may have missed in the results before. Be sure to have the\n",
    "data from the previous lab open in your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moving Beyond *p* &lt; .05\n",
    "==========================\n",
    "\n",
    "In the previous lab, we tested the null hypothesis. We specifically\n",
    "asked: \"what percentage of the time could you get your result if the\n",
    "null were true?\" We called that percentage a *p*-value. The lower the\n",
    "*p*-value, the less easily it is that you could get that result if the\n",
    "null were true. In other words, a low *p*-value means that the data and\n",
    "the null are incompatible. Since we actually did get the data, we reject\n",
    "the null. This is a useful way to test the null hypothesis, but it's not\n",
    "the only way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider one weakness of the procedure outlined above. The null\n",
    "hypothesis states that the sample result is *entirely* due to chance; in\n",
    "the population the effect is completely absent (e.g., in the attitude\n",
    "example in the previous lab, the null said that the average attitude was\n",
    "exactly zero, or *H*<sub>0</sub> : *μ* = 0, meaning that any non-zero\n",
    "result observed in the sample was entirely due to chance). When we\n",
    "reject the null hypothesis, we are rejecting the premise that the\n",
    "results are entirely due to chance. That's about it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, rejecting the null hypothesis tells you what the effect\n",
    "is *not* (i.e., not zero, not due to chance). You aren't saying what the\n",
    "effect *is.* If you want to estimate what is going on in the population,\n",
    "we need to do more, to use our sample estimate as a starting point and\n",
    "add some measure of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence Intervals\n",
    "====================\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the goal of confidence intervals. A confidence interval simply\n",
    "takes your sample result and puts it at the center of a ranged estimate.\n",
    "We know that the sample result has error in it; it's an imperfect\n",
    "estimate of the population. However, we can estimate *how much error*\n",
    "and can use that to create a range around our sample estimate. I will\n",
    "show you an example first, and then I will show you how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load the `attitude` data from the previous lab (re-run the code from the\n",
    "previous lab if you need). We observed a sample average attitude of 2.23\n",
