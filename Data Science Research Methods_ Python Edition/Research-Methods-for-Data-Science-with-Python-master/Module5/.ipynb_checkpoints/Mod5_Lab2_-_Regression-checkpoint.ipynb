    "Regression Concepts\n",
    "===================\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that the purpose of regression is to predict one variable. In\n",
    "this case, let's predict `Happiness`. In regression, this is done by\n",
    "generating an equation that predicts the outcome from one or more\n",
    "predictors. The equation looks like this for a single predictor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y' = b_0 + b_1 x$$\n",
    "\n",
    " In this regression equation, we can guess each person's Y score (*Y*′)\n",
    "by starting with a constant (i.e., intercept, *b*<sub>0</sub>) and\n",
    "adding to that their score on a predictor variable (*x*<sub>1</sub>),\n",
    "multiplied by its respective slope (*b*<sub>1</sub>).\n",
    "\n",
    "We need not only use one predictor:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Y' = b_0 + b_1 x + b_2 x + b_3 x + b_4 x \\ldots$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In regression, you can have as many predictors as you want, and each\n",
    "one you add (assuming it's useful), should improve the accuracy of the\n",
    "prediction. As you can imagine, this is immensely useful in many data\n",
    "science applications, as it literally provides the ability to predict\n",
    "the future.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, imagine we wanted to predict `Happiness` from a series of\n",
    "some of our variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$Happiness = b_0 + b_1 \\cdot GDP + b_2 \\cdot Family + b_3 \\cdot Life\\_Expect + b_4 \\cdot Freedom + \n",
    "b_5 \\cdot Generosity$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In this regression equation, we can guess each person's `Happiness`\n",
    "score by starting with the constant (i.e., intercept, *b*<sub>0</sub>)\n",
    "and adding to that their score on each of the other variables (GDP,\n",
    "Family, Life.Expect, Freedom, Generosity), multiplied by its respective\n",
    "slope\n",
    "(*b*<sub>1</sub>, *b*<sub>2</sub>, *b*<sub>3</sub>, *b*<sub>4</sub>, *b*<sub>5</sub>).\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to helping to predict an outcome, regression is also useful\n",
    "for *understanding* the variables. By definition, the slope is the\n",
    "expected increase in the outcome (e.g., expected gain in happiness) for\n",
    "every one unit of that predictor. For example, if the slope for `GDP`\n",
    "was 2.18, then by definition I expect to gain an additional 2.18 units\n",
    "of happiness for every one unit of GDP. The larger the slope, the more\n",
    "\"potent\" the variable. A large slope means you get a *lot* of the\n",
    "outcome (e.g., a lot of happiness) out for every one unit of the\n",
    "predictor. Conversely, if the slope were zero, the predictor literally\n",
    "would not matter; adding more of that predictor would have no impact on\n",
    "the (prediction of the) outcome. So, the slope can be though of as the\n",
    "importance of that variable for your outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a regression analysis, all that is needed is the set of *b*s.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's try this with a basic regression with one predictor. Let's predict\n",
    "`Happiness` from `GDP`.\n",
    "\n",
    "A Simple Regression\n",
    "===================\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many Python packages for computing linear regression models in Python. In this case we will use the `OLS` (ordinary least squares) function from the Statsmodels package. `OLS`has two arguments, the vector for the response or dependent variable, and an array containing the one or more predictor or independent variables. Notice that in order to get an intercept term ($b_0$) the `add_constant` method must be used to add a constant column to the predictor array. A `summary` method displays a number of statistics from a `response` object."

    "\n",
    "1.  Linear model is appropriate\n",
    "2.  Homoskedasticity\n",
    "3.  Observations are independent\n",
    "4.  Our residuals must be normally distributed\n",
    "5.  Our residuals should have a mean of zero\n",
    "6.  The model is correctly specified\n",
    "7.  Multicollinearity is not a problem\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption 1**, is a linear model appropriate? Well, do we have good\n",
    "reason to suspect a non-linear relationship between GDP and happiness?\n",
    "In this case, I have no theoretical or evidence based reason to think\n",
    "otherwise. However, obviously, a linear model (i.e., a \"straight line\"\n",
    "regression) would not make sense if the data were not a straight line.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are a few cases where this *IS* violated.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  If your y-variable has only two levels (e.g., \"purchased product,\n",
    "    did not purchase product\"), then a linear model is not appropriate\n",
    "    (we use something called *logistic regression*). There are similar\n",
    "    extensions for variables with several categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  Another common case is if your y-variable is a \"count\" of something\n",
    "    (e.g., how many pairs of shoes do people have?). In that case,\n",
    "    negative numbers are impossible, and any slopes will need to \"bend\"\n",
    "    as they approach the x-axis so they don't cross it. There are\n",
    "    \"count\" models for that. We won't learn them, but you could if you\n",
    "    needed to.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  Math allows for any shape of line; for similar reasons, we can make\n",
    "    a regression line into any shape (not covered here). A word of\n",
    "    caution: the more complex a model, the more likely it is to be a\n",
    "    \"false positive\" finding. Beware making models too complex on the\n",
    "    basis of your data. Usually, simpler models are more correct unless\n",
    "    you have good reason to make it non-linear.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption 2**, homoskedasicity. Briefly, this means that the\n",
    "residuals are the same all the way up and down the line. This is\n",
    "violated if residuals are really small at one end (line fits great) and\n",
    "really big at the other (line fits awful). Without going into detail,\n",
    "the *p*-values for the slopes use the residuals in the equations. If the\n",
    "residuals vary systematically throughout the graph, that's a problem.\n",
    "Look at the residuals plot above, however, and we see they seem roughly\n",
    "uniform up and down the line. We're fine.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumption 3**, our observations are independent. That is, our data\n",
    "points didn't influence each other. This would be a problem, for\n",
    "example, if our data included the same regions over a multi-year period.\n",
    "The 2016 happiness score and the 2017 happiness score for a region will\n",
    "be similar because it's the same region. This influences the residuals,\n",
    "and in turn, the *p*-values in a problematic way. *Violating this\n",
    "assumption tends to make your findings **more** significant* so it's\n",
    "good to account for any kind of \"nesting\" substructure.\n",
    "\n",
    "Having multiple data points on the same observation is one common way\n",
    "you can violate this assumption, but other kinds of nesting might as\n",
    "well. For example, data may be nested within stores in a way we might\n",
    "want to account for. In such a case, a *linear mixed model* is often\n",
    "better and simply extends the regression somewhat to account for the\n",
    "nesting.\n",
